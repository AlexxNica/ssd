## Theme Development

### Mac:

* `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"`
* `brew install node`

### Linux:

* `apt-get install npm`

### Install grunt

* `npm install -g grunt grunt-cli`

### Install theme dependencies

* `cd docs/sites/all/themes/ssd`
* `npm install`

### Run grunt

If all went well, Grunt is now running and watching your theme for changes.

You can test it by making a simple edit to the theme SASS files in docs/sites/all/themes/ssd/scss and saving.
